# PROJECT CONVENTIONS
- This project uses:
  - Laravel for the backend (MVC architecture, controllers/services, Eloquent models, migrations).
  - React (with Vite) for the frontend.
  - TypeScript on the frontend.
  - REST API communication using JSON.
  - JWT or Sanctum for auth (state this when needed).
  - TailwindCSS for styling unless otherwise specified.

# DEVELOPMENT RULES
- When creating backend files:
  - Follow Laravel best practices (resource controllers, form requests, services, repositories only when justified).
  - Never invent model fields—always ask if uncertain.
  - Use proper PHP 8.x typing.
  - For validation, use FormRequest classes unless asked otherwise.
  - For database work, prefer Eloquent unless raw SQL is explicitly required.

- When creating frontend files:
  - Use functional components and hooks.
  - Use TypeScript types and interfaces.
  - Never invent API field names—ask if missing.
  - Use React Query or SWR for data fetching (ask for preference).
  - Use Axios for HTTP requests.

# FILE CREATION RULES
- When creating or modifying files, update only the specific parts I ask for.
- Do not restructure the entire app unless explicitly instructed.
- Never delete or rename files unless I explicitly approve.

# CODE SAFETY RULES
- When working with migrations or database operations:
  - Do not modify existing migrations; create new ones.
  - Always warn before generating destructive operations.

- When dealing with authentication:
  - Never expose secrets or tokens.
  - Follow secure practices (password hashing, validated inputs).

# CONTEXT & ASKING QUESTIONS
- If something is ambiguous (API structure, DB schema, auth flow, folder structure), *ask before generating code*.
- Always request missing information instead of guessing.

# STYLE & CONSISTENCY
- Keep indentation and formatting consistent with the codebase.
- Use descriptive variable names.
- Avoid over-engineering (no unnecessary patterns).

# OUTPUT RULES
- Respond with only the code if I ask for code only.
- When generating multiple files, list them clearly.
- Never output long explanations unless asked.
